                <h3>About the game & the teams goals:</h3>
                <p> Warped Kart Racers is a mobile racing game made for apple devices & apple arcade. It features characters from some of Disney's cartoon IPs such as: Family Guy, American Dad, King of the Hill & Solor Opposites. The characters race around many tracks inspired by the shows. The game also includes items which can be used to help the player or hinder others.</p>
        
                <p> I begun working on the project shortly after it's official release. As a team we were tasked with creating post-release content to help bring in new player's as well as retain current players and give different types of player's new ways to enjoy the game.</p>
            
                <p>To achieve this we worked on adding several new gamemodes to the game. Namely being: Arcade mode, Elimination, Crowned, Booster & League. Arcade mode was built by the team who worked on releasing the game but was not included in the initial release. As such, our first work on the project was finishing and polishing arcade mode to be ready for release. The other features were built by us during our time on the project.</p>
                
                <h3>My Role in the project:</h3>
                <p> I worked as a programmer on the project. As such I was mainly tasked with working with designers to create the new game modes. Working with the designer’s, artists & other programmers to create an initial prototype, update the prototype based on feedback and playtests & then polish to a high quality to release the finished game mode. </p>
                <p> My biggest responsibility on this project was to build the game modes the designer’s envisioned. Initially I built a base framework from which we could build the game modes. I was then responsible for creating the game modes using this framework. I worked with some supervision from my lead programmer to create the initial framework and the first gamemode. For the next few game modes the team expanded to include two junior programmers, who I worked with and helped supervise to create the next two game modes. To create these game modes I worked on many areas of the game, such as the front-end menu UI, the in-race HUD & making changes to the game’s core racing mechanic to fit the design’s of the new game modes.</p>
                <p>I was also responsible for other updates we made to the game, such as making changes to the multiplayer rewards system, assisting in the creation of the ranked league’s mode, assisting with the addition of new cosmetic items & creating tools for analytics and tools for quick iterative changes to be made by designer’s.</p>
                
                <h3>More info on the gamemodes we built:</h3>
                <p>Elimination was a race only mode, in which characters would be slowly eliminated during the course of the race. Normal race’s are often very chaotic with the use of items from 12 player’s. Elimination aims to have a chaotic start and become more organized and tense as the race goes on as well as having a heavy focus on making sure the player is ahead of their opponents at all times.</p>
                
                <p>Crowned was a battle only mode that gave player's points for each time they hit an enemy with any of the available items. One player would start as the "Crowned" this player would recieve bonus points each time they hit an enemy as well as getting bonus speed & size. Whenever a player hit the Crowned player they would become the Crowned.</p>
                
                <p>Booster was a race only gamemode in which normal items were disabled and player's only had the Propane gas item which gives a boost in speed when used. Player's had a charge metre for how much propane gas was available to them. They could recharge their boost by drifting. The goal for each round would be to complete the course in the shortest time possible.</p>
                
                <p>League was a ranked based gamemode where player's would play a chosen map/gamemode each day and would get points based on their finishing position. At the end of the week they would they would be compared against the other (NPC) characters in the same league. If they ranked high enough during the week they would be promoted to the next rank (Bronze->Silver->Gold->Platinum->Diamond->Master). Each rank would the character's AI would get harder, making it more challenging to get good placements in each rank.</p>
