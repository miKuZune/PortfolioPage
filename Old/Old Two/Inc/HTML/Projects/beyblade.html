                While working at Antoine Lock my first major project was to create a web based
                game for Beyblade. My role in this project was to build the game itself. The gameplay was designed
                by the designers at Antoine Lock allowing me to choose the technology to use & build the game. 
            </p>
    
            <p>
                For this project I chose to use Unity & C#. This was because it allowed me to quickly create builds & 
                test changes using the Unity editor. This was important as designers often wanted to make small changes
                after seeing their designs having been built. Working with an IP like Beyblade, we also needed to be able to
                make changes to ensure the game made sense within the Beyblade universe and there was nothing incorrect in the
                game that fans would pick up on.
