                For my dissertation I wanted to see if Maching Learning could be used to alter a game 
                in real time and to test wether that would have a signifigant impact on a player's experience.
                So using Unity I created a simple wave based shooter game. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The player had three weapons, an assault rifle, a sniper rifle and a shotgun. I chose these three
                weapons as they seemed the three best weapon types to allow players to express their faviourtie shooter game play styles.
                The shotgun, allowed players to be aggresive and to get up close and personal with the opponenets. The assault rifle allowed players
                to keep the opponenets at a distance & maintain consistent damage. The sniper rifle allowed players to keep enemies at a
                long distance & be rewarded more for hitting critical spots on the opponenets.
            </p>
            <p> 
                This weapon system was the focus for the data collection that would make up the Machine Learning model. By collecting data on a player's preference
                and skill with the different weapons the game could then use the ML model to predict which weapons a player prefered while they were playing. Once the game
                had determined what the player's prefered playstyle was the game would then adjust the enemies behaviour around the player.
            </p>
            <p>
                The enemey AI used a state machine which would control what the enemies were doing at any given time. This would control wether they were running after the 
                player, shooting at the player, running away from the player etc. The state machine would change between these behaviours based on values such as "aggresiveness" & "fear of death", and the input from 
                the in-game world. The ML model predicting the player's prefered play style would change the values in ways which favoured the player's playstyle. For example for a player who prefers to use the shotgun,
                the aggresiveness value would be increased and fear of death would be decreased, which then meant that the enemies would run closer to the player before starting to shoot and would be less likely to 
                run from the player when their health was lowered.
