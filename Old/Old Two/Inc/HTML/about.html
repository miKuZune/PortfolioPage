<h1>About Me</h1>

        I've always loved games. Ever since I was young I've played video games. I first started playing games 
        on my dad's computer, playing kids games we used to get every week from magazines. As I grew up a bit I moved on
        to playing games on the Play Station 2, playing games like Harry Potter: Quidditch World Cup & 
        Star Wars battlefront. I continued playing games, moving onto an Xbox 360 before building my own computer.

        I first found my love of coding in high school on an introductory course where we coded a basic game where
        you control a crab on the beach to pick up seaweed. I quickly sped through the tutorial and began adding and 
        amending, adding a second player and changing the seaweed to other crabs that would chase the player. From 
        there I went on to do Computing at GSCE and A-Level where I continued to use Java.

        After high school I went on to study Computing for Games (BSc) at Falmouth University. I started off using Unreal,
        learing to use Blueprints and C++ in first year. In second & third year I mainly used Unity and C#, while also
        using a small amount of C++. A huge focus of the course was group game projects. Each year we had at least one
        long term group game project where we worked with a multi disciplinary team to create a game. In first year 
        we had a 3 month group project where we used Unreal to create an melee wave based arena game. In second year we
        had a 9 month long project where we used Unity to create a multi-player first person shooter game. In third year 
        we again had a 9 month project where we used Unity again to create a 2.5D metroidvania style game.

        After university I worked as a web developer for a design agency called Antoine Lock where I made websites, games, apps & 
        web technology to suit a clients needs. Initially I was brought for a freelance project making a web based game
        for Beyblade.com whose website was made and maintained by Antoine Lock already. After showing initial prototypes
        for the web game I was asked to join full time. In the first few months I did a lot of learning as web development
        was mostly new to me. I spent a lot of time initally learning JavaScript, PHP, CSS, HTML & Wordpress as these
        were the core languages that were being used to build websites by the design agency. I later also took what I'd 
        learned about JavaScript to learn NodeJS when we were looking to build web technology & learned to use react native
        to build some apps.
