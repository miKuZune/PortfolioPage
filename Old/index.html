				<img class="profile_image" src="Images/NoGlassesHeadShot.jpg">
			</h1>
			<p class="aboutMe"> Hi there! My name's Max. I'm a programmer mainly focused on creating Artificial Intelligence and gameplay systems to immerse and challenge players.
			Using these skills I aim to create systems for games that give player's the most engaging and enjoyable experiences possible.</p>
			<p class="aboutMe"> I've recently finished my final year at Falmouth University studying Computing For Games(BSC). I mainly work with Unity and C# but also have experience with Unreal. 
			I've also worked with a variety of other languages such as C++, Java, Javascript, SQL, HTML and CSS. </p>
			<p class="aboutMe"> I'm a keen student and a hard-worker, constantly looking to learn new techniques and expand my technical knowledge through practical and theoretical learning.</p>

			<h3> <u> Fey</u> </h3>

					<p class="projects_descriptor"><img class="projects_gif_l" src = "Images/fey_snail.gif"> Fey is a 2.5D Metroidvania game made using Unity 2018, where you play as a young girl breaking free from imprisonment and
						her spirit companion who helps her to escape.</p>
					<p class="projects_descriptor"> On this project my main responsibility was creating the AI that the player has to fight as they traverse through the levels. I also programmed the Combat, Save System and 
						Cutscenes in the game, as well as managing the teams use of Version Control, working with other programmers to find and solve bugs and working with other team members (such as artists) to implement their work and ideas.</p>

			<h2><u> Game Jams </u></h2>
			
			<h3> <u> Penguin Planet - GlobalGameJam 2019 </u> </h3>
			<div class="projects_container" style = "padding-bottom:10%;">
				<p class="projects_descriptor"><img class="projects_gif_l" src = "Images/PenguinPlanet.gif"> Penguin Planet is a light-hearted resource management game where you have to send your rather well-dressed 
					penguins off to collect resources needed for the colony.</p>
				<p class="projects_descriptor"> For this project I was the only programmer on a team of 8 and was responsible for the programming (Automated camera, Penguin AI, UI & Day-Night cycle) for the game as well as 
					working with the rest of the team to rapidly implement their work.</p>

			<h3> <u> Mecha Melee: Rome Edition - GlobalGameJam 2018 </u> </h3>
			<div class="projects_container">
				<p class="projects_descriptor"><img class="projects_gif_r" src = "Images/MechaMelee.gif"> MechaMelee is a Sci-Fi gladiatorial where you fight as one of many robots trying to survive the onslaught of the arena. 
					Your main ability is the power to transfer your AI/consciousness into the other robots, allowing you to regain your health and continue the battle.</p>
				<p class="projects_descriptor"> For this project the team's skill sets not very diverse as the team was made up of 4 programmers and 3 artists. 
					As such we all had to take on roles that were outside out comfort zones.</p>
				<p class="projects_descriptor" style ="padding-right:45%;"> In my case I took on a leadership and design role for the project, in addition to programming the AI.
					I was responsible for giving each member of the team their tasks, based on what skills they possessed outside of the specialties. I also took on the design role, 
					creating the level for the game to be played in and ensuring that all members of the team had a shared vision of the game. For this game I also programmed the AI,
					which presented additional challenges because of the main mechanic of being able to take control of the enemies.</p>

			<h3> <u> Ludum Dare 2017 - Toy Hero</u> </h3>
			<div class="projects_container">
				<p class="projects_descriptor"><img class="projects_gif_l" src = "Images/toyHero.jpg"> Toy Hero is a game where you play as a toy robot who has to run around a child's bedroom, 
					hiding as many other toys as possible before mum tidies them away, never to be seen again. It's a round based game with a time limit that gives you score for however many toys you manage to hide.
					The more toys you save in one round the more there will be to save in the next.</p>
				<p class="projects_descriptor"> This was my first game jam and I created the game on my own. Through this project I learned a lot about areas of game development outside of programming, 
					which has helped me a lot when working with others to implement their work into the project.</p>
