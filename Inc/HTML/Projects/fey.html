                In my third year of university our group game project was a 2.5D metroidvania
                style game we called Fey. Working with a multidisiplinary group we created a 
                combat system, puzzles & intricate levels for the player to explore & experience
                the story of the world & the characters.
            </p>
            <p>
                My main responsibility for this project was to create the AI's that would serve as the player's
                main adversaries. For this I used a state machine so that the AI's could have multiple behaviours
                & could easily change their behaviours. An Idle state was used to control enemies patrolling areas of
                the levels. When the player got close to the enemies they would change their state to an agressive behaivour 
                where they would look to attack the player.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was also responsible for creating the save game system that allowed the player to save the game so they could stop playing
                & come back to the same point later. As well as helping the other programmers using pair programming to create systems such as
                the player's movement & debug problems. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I was also responsible for our version control, helping other members of the team to commit their work, and fixing the repository anytime
                there were conflicts or problems.
